##  Introduction  ##

This file contains the source code and description for the package-creation script for the J+ package management system.
It is targeted at package authors, and should be read in conjunction with the more general J+ [README](README.litcoffee).

###  Basic usage:  ###

A basic J+ package template is a JavaScript script as follows:

>   ```html
>   <!DOCTYPE html>
>   <html>
>       <title>Package Title</title>
>       <meta charset="utf-8">
>       <script type="text/javascript" src="jplus-pkg.js">
>       <script type="text/javascript">
>           /*  Package script  */
>       </script>
>       /*  (optional) Package documentation  */
>   </html>
>   ```

The [`jplus-pkg.js`](jplus-pkg.js) creates the Data, Tools, and Settings objects and references them from `window` object properties.
It additionally defines several functions which you can use when designing your package.
Consequently, it should be loaded **before** the package script(s).

Multiple package scripts are allowed, although it is recommended that scripts be loaded synchronously.
Any non-script content (with the exception of the `<title>` element) is ignored by the J+ package loader.

###  The Data object:  ###

The Data object stores all of the properties intended to be available from outside of the package.
It is accessible from `window["ðŸ“¦"]`, which is defined to be non-configurable and non-overwritable.

In addition, the following aliases are defined, but *may* be configured, deleted, or overwritten.
Of course, you are also free to define your own aliases.

- `window.data`
- `window["j-plus-data"]`
- `window.jplus_data`

(For consistency and simplicity, this document will always use `window["ðŸ“¦"]` to refer to the Data object.)

####  Permitted content  ####

The Data object is passed to external scripts via `window.postMessage()`, so only content which can be processed throught [the structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) is allowed.

The special property `"ðŸ“›"` returns the package title and is not configurable or overwritable.

###  The Settings object:  ###

The Settings object stores properties used by the J+ package loader to initialize the package.
It is accessible from `window.â„¹`, which is defined to be non-configurable and non-overwritable.

In addition, the following aliases are defined, but *may* be configured, deleted, or overwritten.
Of course, you are also free to define your own aliases.

- `window.settings`
- `window["j-plus-settings"]`
- `window.jplus_settings`

(For consistency and simplicity, this document will always use `â„¹` to refer to the Settings object.)

####  Available settings  ####

The settings configurable through the Settings object are as follows. Note that no other properties may be added to the Settings object, and these properties may not be deleted.

|     Property      |    Type    |  Initial value   | Description |
| ----------------- | :--------: | :--------------: | :---------- |
| `â„¹.initScript`   | `function` | `function () {}` | A function to run when the package has finished loading. This takes one argument, which is the initialization data. |
| `â„¹.targetorigin` |  `string`  |      `"*"`       | The target origin to be used with `window.postMessage()`. |
| `â„¹.title`        |  `string`  | `document.title` | The title of the package. |

Default values for Settings object properties are calculated when the J+ PKG script is loaded.
Consequently, the J+ PKG script should be loaded *after* the `<title>` element if the default value for `â„¹.title` is intended to be used.

###  The Tools object:  ###

The Tools object contains functions and tools for use with package creation.
It is accessible from `window["ðŸ› "]`, which is defined to be non-configurable and non-overwritable.

In addition, the following aliases are defined, but *may* be configured, deleted, or overwritten.
Of course, you are also free to define your own aliases.

- `window.tools`
- `window["j-plus-tools"]`
- `window.jplus_tools`

(For consistency and simplicity, this document will always use `window["ðŸ› "]` to refer to the Tools object.)

###  General variables and functions:  ###

####  Whitelist and loading parameters  ####

J+ packages communicate using `window.postMessage()`.
Consequently, for security reasons, they need a whitelist to keep track of which URLs to accept messages from.
These are stored alongside their loading parameters in `pkgs`.

    pkgs = {}

####  Initialization on load  ####

The following script processes the Settings object and notifies the parent:

    init = (using) ->

#####  initialization  #####

Our first point of order is to run the user-defined initialization script from the Settings object:

        â„¹.initScript using

#####  notifying the parent  #####

J+ packages are loaded into `<iframe>`s, and use `window.parent.postMessage()` to inform their parents that they are loaded.
Of course, if `window.parent` does not exist, nothing can be done.
The contents of this message is the Data object.

        parent?.postMessage window["ðŸ“¦"], â„¹.targetorigin
        return

####  Running `init()`  ####

We use a `"message"` event handler to run the initialization script after we have received initialization parameters from the parent window.
This is processed using `receiveMessage()`

    receiveMessage = (e) ->

First we want to make sure that the message came from the window's parent.

        return unless e.origin is parent.location.origin

We can now process `init()` using the provided data.

        init e.data

Now that `init()` has been run, we don't want to receive any more messages.

        window.removeEventListener "message", receiveMessage, false
        return

This creates our event listener:

    window.addEventListener "message", receiveMessage, false

###  J+:  ###

The J+ object starts out containing only one attribute, the special attribute `"ðŸ“›"`, which uses a getter to get the current package title.

    data = Object.defineProperty({}, "ðŸ“›", {get: -> â„¹.title})

We assign this object to its various aliases on `window`.

    Object.defineProperties window, {
        "ðŸ“¦": {value: data}
        "data": {value: data, writable: true, configurable: true}
        "j-plus-data": {value: data, writable: true, configurable: true}
        "jplus_data": {value: data, writable: true, configurable: true}
    }

###  Settings:  ###

Next, we can set up the Settings object with its default values.
The default values are scoped and accessed using getters and setters, in order to ensure proper typing.

    initScript = ->
    targetorigin = "*"
    title = document.title

    settings = Object.defineProperties({}, {
        initScript:
            get: -> initScript
            set: (n) -> if n instanceof Function then initScript = n else initScript = Function(n)
        targetorigin:
            get: -> targetorigin
            set: (n) -> targetorigin = String(n)
        title:
            get: -> title
            set: (n) -> title = String(n)
    })

We should freeze the Settings object to safeguard it from unscrupulous modification:

    Object.freeze settings

Finally, we need to assign references to the Settings object to our various aliases:

    Object.defineProperties window, {
        "â„¹": {value: settings}
        "settings": {value: settings, writable: true, configurable: true}
        "j-plus-settings": {value: settings, writable: true, configurable: true}
        "jplus_settings": {value: settings, writable: true, configurable: true}
    }

###  Tools:  ###

Our final order of business is to create the Tools object.
This contains all of the convenience functions that J+ PKG provides to package creators.

    tools =

The `handleEvent` function handles all events related to Tools object operation.
Notably, it manages the loading of packages.

        handleEvent: (e) ->
            switch e.type
                when "message"

Messages are only loaded if they have been whitelisted in `pkgs`.
`handleEvent()` freezes them and handles their loading parameters.
Once the package has been loaded, we can remove the corresponding `<iframe>` and de-list its URL.

                    if pkgs.hasOwnProperty(e.source.location.href)
                        from = e.source.location.href
                        Object.freeze e.data
                        Object.defineProperty(window["ðŸ“¦"], pkgs[from].into, {value: e.data, enumerable: true, configurable: true}) if pkgs[from].into?
                        pkgs[from].andthen(e.data) if pkgs[from].andthen?
                        document.body.removeChild pkgs[from].frame
                        delete pkgs[from]
            return

The `loadPackage()` function loads another package as a sub-module of this one.
The argument `using` provides initialization parameters which are passed to the package.
The optional argument `into` specifies a property name for the J+ object to load the package into.
If not specified, the package will not be transparent to external scripts.
The optional argument `andthen` accepts a callback function to be called after package load.

        loadPackage: (from, using, into, andthen) ->

First, we need to get the absolute URL and origin associated with `from`.
The following code achieves this:

            a = document.createElement('A')
            a.href = from
            from = a.href
            from_origin = a.origin
            from_origin ?= a.protocol + "//" + a.host

Now we can create our iframe and make it hidden.

            pkgelt = document.createElement('IFRAME')
            pkgelt.style.display = "none"

Next, we add the domain to the whitelist, alongside its loading parameters.
If the domain already exists, then we throw a `TypeError`.

            throw new TypeError("package '" + from + "' has already been queued") if pkgs[from]?
            Object.defineProperty(pkgs, from, {
                value: Object.freeze({frame: pkgelt, into: into, andthen: andthen})
                enumerable: true
                configurable: true
            })

We send our package the initialization paramaters provided by `using`, but only after the package has fully loaded.

            pkgelt.addEventListener "load", (-> pkgelt.contentWindow.postMessage(using, from_origin)), false

Finally, we set the `src` and append the element to the document's body.
(This is required for script execution.)
If the `<body>` element has not yet been loaded, we need to set an event handler:

            pkgelt.src = from
            if document.body? then document.body.appendChild(pkgelt) else document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (-> document.body.appendChild(pkgelt)), false)
            return

We should freeze the Tools object to safeguard it from unscrupulous modification:

    Object.freeze tools

Finally, we need to assign references to the Tools object to our various aliases:

    Object.defineProperties window, {
        "ðŸ› ": {value: tools}
        "tools": {value: tools, writable: true, configurable: true}
        "j-plus-tools": {value: tools, writable: true, configurable: true}
        "jplus_tools": {value: tools, writable: true, configurable: true}
    }
